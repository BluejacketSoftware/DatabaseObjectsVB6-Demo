<h1><strong>Welcome to the DatabaseObjects demonstration</strong><br>
</h1>
<p>This program provides some examples of the different ways the Database
  Objects (DBO) library can be used. Currently,
  the
  DBO
  library
  can
  successfully connect to SQL Server and Microsoft Access databases. If you would
  like me to add another database feel free to send me an email - <a href="mailto:toby.wicks@hisystems.com.au">toby.wicks@hisystems.com.au</a>.
  By default the
  program will connect to the <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\nwind.mdb </strong>  database.
  The nwind.mdb database is available at the Microsoft website <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C6661372-8DBE-422B-8676-C632D66C529C&displaylang=EN" target="_blank">here</a> should
  you need it. If you would like to test with SQL
  Server uncomment
  the
  NorthWindDB.Connect_SQLServer
  function in frmMain and change the database server if necessary. Or to test
  with MySQL extract the mysql version of the northwind database from <a href="../../../data/mysql_northwind.zip">data/mysql_northwind.zip</a> into
  the data directory and uncomment the NorthWindDB.Connect_MySQL function in
  frmMain. To
  view all of the SQL statements that are being executed, turn on
  the DebugSQL compilation
  option in the DBO project.</p>
<h3><br>
  1. View Suppliers</h3>
<p>Demonstrates some of the DBO basics, including adding, editing
  and deleting a list of suppliers. It also demonstrates maintaing referential
  integrity by not allowing  suppliers to be deleted if they are referenced
  by a product. This particular feature is implemented in the Supplier.IsDeletable
  property.</p>
<h3><br>
  2. View Products </h3>
<p>Demonstrates the use of the IDatabaseObjects_Subset
  function in the Products class. IDatabaseObjects_Subset allows the Products
  class to either contain ALL of the products in the database or only contain
  the products for a particular category.</p>
<h3><br>
  3. View an Order</h3>
<p>Demonstrates an implementation for a <em>header </em>and
  associated<em> detail</em> table. In this example, with the Orders and OrderDetails
  tables.</p>
<h3><br>
  4. Search Products</h3>
<p>Demonstrates how to implement the IDatabaseObjects_Search
function in the Products class.</p>
<h3><br>
  5. Search Products (Extended)</h3>
<p>Demonstrates a more complex set of search criteria as opposed
  to the simple search demonstrated in the 'Search Products' window.
  It also demonstrates joining tables (in this case the Products table
  and
  the Supplier table) to optimise the loading speed of the products, in addition
  to demonstrating how to load a
Product and Supplier object from the same database record.</p>
